# Inn.ts Documentation

Inn.ts is a simple framework for building apps in React using Vite. Compared to other frameworks such as Next.js, we focus on interactivity, performance, portability, and TypeScript support. Inn.ts apps build into an Single Page Application (SPA) making it easy to deploy them to any hosting platform, like Innatical Cloud or Cloudflare Pages.

## Installation

Simply run `npx degit innatical/inn.ts-template <project name>`. This will clone the Inn.ts template project. From there, `cd` into the folder and run `yarn` to install dependencies. To start a dev server, run `yarn dev`.
