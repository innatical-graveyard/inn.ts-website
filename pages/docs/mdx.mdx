# MDX

[MDX](https://mdxjs.com/) allows you to write JSX within Markdown and add it to your React App.

## Setting up MDX within Inn.ts

_**Note:** If you're using the offical Inn.ts template this setup is done for you!_

1. Install MDX as a dev dependency using your preferred package manager (with yarn: `yarn add -D vite-plugin-mdx @mdx-js/mdx@next @mdx-js/react`).
2. Add MDX to your `vite.config.ts`. It should look something like this:

```ts
import { defineConfig } from "vite";
import react from "@vitejs/plugin-react";
import inn from "@innatical/inn.ts";
import mdx from "vite-plugin-mdx";

// https://vitejs.dev/config/
export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [react(), mdx(), inn()],
});
```

## Using MDX

Simply drop your MDX files in the `/pages` folder (or whatever folder(s) you're routing). If you need more info on MDX itself see the [MDX docs](https://mdxjs.com/getting-started/).
